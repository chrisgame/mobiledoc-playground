# mobiledoc-playground

This repository contains an application to show a working example of an ember-mobiledoc-editor with it's content displayed in it's stored form, renderered in dom and rendered as text.

The basic example of this lives on the master branch.
Futher specific examples tht build upon this are available on the following branches...

* code-block-card *pre formated whitespace editor*
  * code-block-parser *allows pre tags to be transformed into valid code-block-card payload when pasted in the editor*
* logo-atom *basic atom example that is substituted when a specific text string is typed in the editor*
  * logo-atom-options *options are passed in to the dom renderer and used within the atoms logic*
